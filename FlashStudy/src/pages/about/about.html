    On the "sign in" page, click sign in to continue to the rest of the app.
    <br><br>
    I removed the back buttons generated by ionic and added my own so I could have more
    /easier control over the look.
    <br><br>
    On the sets page, click "example set" to see an example of a set of cards, the
    other sets are just filler. Click "add set" to see the page for adding a new set.
    <br><br>
    The icons associated with the sets are all set to "flask" right now, but I intend
    to give a selection of icons that the user can choose as the icon for each
    set.
    <br><br>
    On the example set page, clicking a card will prompt an alert, I intend to implement
    it where the back is hidden until you tap the card.
    <br><br>
    On the Example set page, there is an icon in the top right that brings you to
    the "set settings" pop over page.
    <br><br>
    on the set settings pop over page, clicking "add cards" will bring you to the
    "new cards" page.
